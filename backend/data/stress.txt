Stress is the bodyâ€™s natural response to challenges or demands. It occurs when we feel unable to cope with pressure, whether from work, relationships, studies, or personal issues. Stress can be short-term (acute) or long-term (chronic). Acute stress occurs during specific situations like exams or deadlines, while chronic stress continues over time and can lead to serious health problems. Common symptoms of stress include irritability, fatigue, muscle tension, headaches, and difficulty sleeping. Prolonged stress can weaken the immune system and increase the risk of conditions such as high blood pressure, heart disease, and mental health issues. Disorders related to stress include Acute Stress Disorder (which develops shortly after a traumatic event) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), which involves long-lasting anxiety, flashbacks, and emotional numbness after trauma. Managing stress involves regular physical activity, deep breathing exercises, mindfulness, healthy eating, and maintaining social connections. Seeking counseling or therapy can also help individuals learn coping mechanisms and reduce long-term effects.
