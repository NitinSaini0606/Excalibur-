Anxiety is a feeling of fear, worry, or unease that is a normal reaction to stress. However, when it becomes excessive, persistent, and interferes with daily life, it is considered an anxiety disorder. Anxiety disorders are among the most common mental health conditions and can include Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), Panic Disorder, Social Anxiety Disorder, Phobias, and Separation Anxiety Disorder. Common symptoms of anxiety include restlessness, increased heart rate, sweating, trembling, difficulty concentrating, and feelings of impending doom. Anxiety can be triggered by genetic predisposition, brain chemistry imbalances, personality factors, or traumatic experiences. Treatment options include therapy (especially cognitive behavioral therapy), medication, mindfulness, regular exercise, and stress management. Understanding and addressing the root cause of anxiety can help individuals regain control over their emotions and daily life.
