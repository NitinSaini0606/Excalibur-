Depression is a mental health disorder characterized by persistent sadness, loss of interest in activities, and feelings of hopelessness or worthlessness. It affects how a person thinks, feels, and behaves, and can lead to a variety of emotional and physical problems. Symptoms of depression include fatigue, trouble concentrating, changes in appetite or sleep patterns, and suicidal thoughts in severe cases. Depression can be caused by a combination of genetic, biological, environmental, and psychological factors. It often develops after stressful events, trauma, loss, or long-term negative thought patterns. Treatment options include psychotherapy (especially cognitive behavioral therapy), antidepressant medications, lifestyle changes such as regular exercise, healthy sleep, and strong social support. It is important to seek help early, as untreated depression can severely affect quality of life but is highly treatable with proper care.
